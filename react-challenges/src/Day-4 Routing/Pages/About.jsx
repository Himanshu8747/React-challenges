        4ocean’s About Us page puts its mission statement front and center. 
        This approach can work well for a mission-driven brand that’s working toward a goal its audience can get behind. 

        4ocean’s plastic crisis plan is such a key part of why it creates accessories and apparel. 
        It divides its About Us page into separate sections that go in depth on its operations, the Osborne Reef, and its impact on the environment. 
        Much like 4ocean, consider splitting your About Us page into specific subpages and showcase your value proposition for the biggest impact.
